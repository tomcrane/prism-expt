# Test

This is a code block

{: .line-numbers }
```javascript

var x = 10;
alert(x);

```

How do we include a file for highlighting? This is done client side:

{: .line-numbers data-src="manifest.json" }
```json
```

And now a block with some highlights


{: .line-numbers data-src="manifest.json" data-line="10,20" }
```json
```
